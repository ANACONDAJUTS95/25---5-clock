# 25 + 5 Clock

This project is a minimalist countdown timer inspired by Google's Material UI design principles. It features a clean, simple interface that focuses on functionality and ease of use.

While this was the most frustrating project I tackled, it turned out to be the most rewarding once it was up and running.

## Features
- Adjustable session and break lengths
- Start, pause, and reset functionality
- Simple, responsive design

## How to Use
1. Set the desired session and break lengths using the + and - buttons.
2. Click "Start" to begin the timer. 
3. Click "Pause" to halt the timer, and "Reset" to return to initial settings.

Feel free to explore and modify the code as you see fit!
